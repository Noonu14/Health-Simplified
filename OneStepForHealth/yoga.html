      <img src="Chair-Pose.png" alt="Utkatasana">
      <h2>2. Chair Pose - Utkatasana</h2>
      <p>The Chair Pose is an exercise that resembles a squat, but in reality, differs from it. Your feet are close together as you lift your upper body while keeping your lower body firmly grounded. This requires balance and concentration. Practicing this pose will help strengthen the core and leg muscles essential for more challenging poses.

        How to do:
        
        Stand straight on your mat.
        Bend your knees and drop your hips as if you’re sitting back in a chair.
        Reach your arms up alongside your ears. Lift your chest and look straight.
        Engage your core and lift up through your chest, keeping a straight back and letting the shoulder fall away from your ears.
        Hold for 10 breaths.</p>
    </div>

      <img src="Triangle-pose-1.png" alt="Triconasana">
      <h2>3.Triangle Pose - Triconasana</h2>
      <p>Triangle Pose is a basic posture for yogis of any level. You’ll want to make sure your body is aligned. It’s particularly great for opening the chest and hips and stretching the hamstrings.

        How to do:
        
        Begin with a comfortable wide stand. Turn your right foot 90 degrees out and your left foot slightly in. Bring the right heel in line with the left heel.
        On the exhalation shift your hips to the left and tilt your torso to the right while reaching to the right side as far as you can. Let your right palm come down to rest either on your thigh, shin, or on the floor.
        Reach straight up with your other hand. Keep the torso aligned with the hips. The back heel is pressing to the floor. Keep the knees straight and lift the kneecaps up. Gaze towards the raised hand.

      <h2>4.Mountain Pose - Tadasana</h2>
      <p>Yoga Mountain Pose (Tadasana) is a pose for complete beginners, and it’s an excellent way to learn the basics of Yoga. This pose will help you to feel grounded in your feet while also consciously engaging different parts of the body. Regularly practicing Mountain Pose can help improve posture and relieve pain, as well as provide correct alignment for the rest of your yoga practice.

        In addition to its physical benefits, Mountain Pose is a great way to bring calmness and steadiness to your body, mind, and spirit. It can also be used as a starting point for other standing poses, allowing you to check in with your alignment before moving into the next pose. Spend several breaths here focusing on grounding yourself in the present moment before transitioning into the next posture.
        
        How to do:
        
        Begin in Mountain Pose by standing with your feet touching, grounding all ten toes and the edges of the feet into the floor.
        Engage your quadriceps so that the knees and top of the thighs draw up and back slightly rotating inward.
        Activate your core to ensure a neutral pelvis position pointing forward rather than downward.
        Slightly tuck in the tailbone while keeping the spine neutral, not rounded or arched. The glutes should be relaxed but the back of the thighs engage enough to lift them.
        Lift up through the chest, pressing shoulder blades back and let shoulders fall down from ears for extra neck elongation. Arms should hang straight down by your sides slightly engaged and internally rotated with fingers together and extended.
